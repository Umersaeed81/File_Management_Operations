# Advanced File Filtering and Management Techniques
![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Advanced_File_Filtering_and_Management_Techniques.png?raw=true)

In the realm of data management and file processing, the ability to efficiently filter and manage files is crucial. As datasets and file collections grow, the need to identify and work with specific files based on various criteria becomes increasingly important. This chapter delves into advanced techniques for filtering and managing files, focusing on methods that allow for precise control over file selection based on naming conventions, size, and content.

The first technique covered is file filtering by name patterns. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large directories containing files with naming conventions that follow specific patterns. By using wildcard characters and pattern matching, you can easily locate files that fit predefined criteria. This is helpful in scenarios where files are categorized by project, date, or type, and you need to focus on only those that meet certain naming standards.

Next, we explore filtering files based on their size. This method is essential when managing disk space or ensuring that only files within a specific size range are processed. Whether youâ€™re looking to exclude large files that could be cumbersome to handle or focus on smaller files that are more manageable, filtering by size allows for effective data management. This technique is often employed to avoid performance issues or to ensure that only relevant files are included in a dataset.

Combining multiple filtering criteria, such as name patterns and size restrictions, offers a more refined approach to file management. By applying both filters simultaneously, you can narrow down your file selection to those that precisely meet all specified conditions. This dual-layer filtering is useful for complex scenarios where files need to adhere to specific naming conventions and also fall within a certain size range, optimizing your data processing tasks.

Finally, the chapter introduces the use of regular expressions for more complex file filtering. Regular expressions provide a robust way to match filenames based on intricate patterns, including those that involve both numeric and alphabetic characters. This method is especially powerful when dealing with files that follow less straightforward naming conventions, enabling you to capture files that fit nuanced criteria that simple patterns might not cover.

Together, these techniques provide a comprehensive toolkit for advanced file management, allowing for greater flexibility and control over file processing tasks. By mastering these methods, you can enhance your ability to manage large volumes of data efficiently and effectively, tailored to your specific needs and requirements.

## 1. Listing All Files in a Directory

The code uses the glob function to list all files in the directory `D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/`. It retrieves the paths of all files, regardless of their extensions, within the specified directory and stores them in the `df` variable as a list. This can be useful for tasks such as file management, batch processing, or analyzing the contents of a directory.

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-01.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries
from glob import glob
# filter out required files
df = glob('D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/*.*')
df
```
### Output

    ['D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\03_PRS.csv',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\1234_US_G.txt',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\15031984_AliSaeed.txt',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\19980802_UmerSaeed.xlsx',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\AS_123_US.xlsx',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Babar_Azam.xlsx',

     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\US_123_AS.xlsx',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\US_Test.xlsx']

## 2. Recursively Listing All Files in a Directory and Its Subdirectories

The code uses the glob function to recursively list all files within the directory `D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/` and its subdirectories. By using the pattern `**/*.*` and setting `recursive=True`, the code retrieves the paths of all files, regardless of their extensions, from the main directory and all its nested subdirectories. This approach is helpful for comprehensive directory searches, batch processing, and tasks involving large directory structures with multiple layers.

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-02.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries
from glob import glob
# filter out required files
df = glob('D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/**/*.*',recursive=True)
df

     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Umer\\US_Test.xlsx']

 
## 3. Listing Files in Subdirectories with Any Extension (Not Including Top-Level Directory)

**Search for Files:** Locate files within the specified source directory (`D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/`) and its subdirectories.

**File Matching:** Include files with any extension (`*.*`).

**List of Files:** Return a list of all files from the subdirectories (but not from the specified directory itself) that match the pattern.

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-03.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries
from glob import glob
# filter out required files
df = glob('D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/**/*.*',recursive=False)
df
```
### Output

    ['D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\BH\\g.txt'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\DA\\a.csv'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\DA\\AS_1234_US.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\DA\\b.txt'

     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Umer\\US_123_AS.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Umer\\US_Test.xlsx']

## 4. Listing All CSV Files in a Directory

The code uses the `glob` function to retrieve all files with the `.csv` extension from the directory `D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/`. By specifying the pattern `'*.csv'`, the code filters and lists only the CSV files located directly within the specified directory. This is useful for tasks such as processing or analyzing CSV files specifically in that directory

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-04.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries
from glob import glob
# filter out required files
df = glob('D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/*.csv')
df
```
### Output

    ['D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\03_PRS.csv',
    'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Hello_US.csv']

## 5. Recursively Listing All CSV Files in a Directory and Its Subdirectories

The code uses the `glob` function to recursively list all files with a `.csv` extension within the directory `D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/` and its subdirectories. By specifying the pattern `'**/*.csv'` and setting `recursive=True`, the code retrieves paths to all CSV files, including those located in any nested subdirectories. This is useful for comprehensive file searches and processing across multiple directory levels.

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-05.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries
from glob import glob
# filter out required files
df = glob('D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/**/*.csv',recursive=True)
df
```
### Output

    ['D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\03_PRS.csv'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Hello_US.csv'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\DA\\a.csv'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\DA\\d.csv'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\DA\\Hello_t_US.csv']
     
## 6. Filtering Files with Multiple Extensions from a Directory

The code filters and retrieves all files with specified extensions (`.xlsx` and `.txt`) from a given directory (`D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/`). It uses a list of patterns and the `glob` function to search for files matching each pattern. The resulting list `df` contains the paths of all Excel and text files found directly in the specified source directory. This is useful for selectively processing files of different types within a single directory.

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-06.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries
from glob import glob
# source directory
source_directory = 'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/'
# Define the required file extension 
patterns = ['*.xlsx', '*.txt']
# filter out required files
df = [file for pattern in patterns for file \
      in glob(f'{source_directory}{pattern}')]
df
```
### Output

    ['D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\19980802_UmerSaeed.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\AS_123_US.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Babar_Azam.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\g_US.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Ijlal_Khan.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Test.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Test1.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\US_123_AS.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\US_Test.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\1234_US_G.txt'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\15031984_AliSaeed.txt'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\gmail.txt'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\g_AS.txt'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Pakistan_1947-08-14.txt'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\US1234.txt']

## 7. Recursively Filtering Files with Multiple Extensions from a Directory and Its Subdirectories

The code recursively searches for and retrieves all files with specified extensions (`.xlsx` and `.txt`) from a given directory (`D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/`) and its subdirectories. By combining a list of patterns with the `glob` function and setting `recursive=True`, the code collects the paths of all Excel and text files found across the directory and its nested subdirectories. This approach is useful for batch processing, file management, or analysis tasks that involve multiple file types across multiple directory levels.

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-07.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries

## 31. Recursively Filtering Files with Multiple Keywords and Extensions from a Directory and Its Subdirectories

The code recursively searches for and retrieves files from the directory `D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/` and its subdirectories that match various keyword patterns (`*AS*`, `*US*`) and file extensions (`.xlsx`, `.txt`). By generating all possible combinations of these patterns and extensions, it uses `glob` to find files that fit any of these criteria. The results are combined using `itertools.chain` to aggregate all matching files, and duplicates are removed by converting the results to a set. The final output is a list of unique file paths that meet the specified keyword and extension criteria across multiple directory levels.

```python
# import required libraries
from glob import glob
from itertools import product, chain

# Source directory
source_directory = 'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/**/'

# Define the base patterns and extensions
base_patterns = ['*AS*', '*US*']
extensions = ['.xlsx', '.txt']

# Generate all combinations of base patterns with extensions
patterns = [f'{source_directory}{base_pattern}{extension}' \
            for base_pattern, extension in product(base_patterns, extensions)]

# filter out required files
df = list(set(chain.from_iterable(glob(pattern,recursive=True) for pattern in patterns)))
df

## 44. Filtering Files with Multiple Prefixes Based on Size from a Directory 

The code filters files in the directory `D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/` that match multiple prefix patterns (e.g., `'US*`.' and `'AS.*'`) and are smaller than 500 KB. It uses `glob` to locate files that start with the specified prefixes. The `os.path.getsize` function is then used to filter these files based on their size, ensuring only files under 500 KB are included. The result is a list of file paths for files that meet both the prefix and size criteria, enabling efficient management or processing of smaller files with the specified prefixes.

## 58. Filtering Files Based on Suffix and Size from a Directory Using Multiple Patterns

The objective of this code is to:

**1. Define Base Patterns and Extensions:** Specify patterns that match filenames ending with certain suffixes (`*AS` and `*US`) and extensions (`.xlsx` and `.txt`).

**2. Generate File Patterns:** Create a list of file path patterns by combining the base patterns with the extensions.

**3. Filter Files by Size:** Search for files in the source directory that match these patterns, check their sizes, and include only those files smaller than 500 KB.

**4. Remove Duplicates:** Collect these files into a unique list, ensuring no duplicate file paths are included.

## 60. Filtering Files by Multiple Keywords and Extensions Based on Size

The code aims to filter and list files from a specified directory (`D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/`) based on a combination of multiple keywords and file extensions. It looks for files that match patterns involving keywords (`*AS*`, `*US*`) and extensions (`.xlsx`, `.txt`). It then checks each file's size and includes only those files that are smaller than 500 KB in the final list. The search is performed within the specified directory but does not include subdirectories.

## 61. Filtering Files Based on Multiple Keywords and Extensions from Directory and Subdirectories, Limited by Size

This code generates a list of file paths by combining specified base patterns and extensions, and then filters the files based on their size. The steps are as follows:

1. **Define Source Directory**: Specifies the base directory where the search will be performed, including all its subdirectories.

2. **Set Patterns and Extensions**: Defines patterns for filenames and file extensions to be combined.

3. **Generate File Patterns**: Creates a list of search patterns by combining base patterns and file extensions.

4. **Filter Files**: Searches for files matching the generated patterns recursively within the source directory, and filters out files whose size is less than 500 KB.

# Source directory
source_directory = 'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/'
# filter out required files
df = [file for file in glob(f'{source_directory}/*[0-9]*.*')]

## 63. Filtering Files from Directory and Subdirectories Based on Numeric Characters in Filenames

The code aims to search for files in a specified source directory (`D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/`) and all its subdirectories that have filenames containing numeric characters (0-9). It uses the `glob` function with a wildcard pattern (`*[0-9]*.*`) to match any files where the filename contains at least one numeric character. The `recursive=True` option allows the search to include all subdirectories within the specified source directory. The matched files are then stored in the list `df`.

```python
# import required libraries
from glob import glob
# Source directory
source_directory = 'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/**/'
# filter out required files
df = [file for file in glob(f'{source_directory}/*[0-9]*.*',recursive=True)]

## 75. Filter Files Based on File Name Length (Including File Extension)

Filter files in the source directory to include only those with filenames that are 20 characters or fewer in length.

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-75.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries
import os
from glob import glob

# Source directory
source_directory = 'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/*.*'

# Filter files based on filename length
df = [file for file in glob(f'{source_directory}')
    if len(os.path.basename(file)) <= 20]
df
```

## 76. Filter Files Based on Specific Subdirectory Names

Filter files from specific subdirectories (`DA` and `BH`) within the source directory.

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-76.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries
import os
from glob import glob

# Source directory
source_directory = 'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/'

# Define the subdirectory names to filter
subdirectories = ['DA', 'BH']

# Filter files based on subdirectory names
df = [file for subdir in subdirectories
    for file in glob(f'{source_directory}/{subdir}/*.*', recursive=True)]
df
```
### Output

    ['D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed//DA\\a.csv'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed//DA\\AS_1234_US.xlsx'
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed//DA\\b.txt'

from glob import glob

# Source directory
source_directory = 'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/'

# Define the subdirectory names to filter
subdirectories = ['DA', 'BH']

# Include files from the source_directory and the specified subdirectories only
df = []

# Include files from the source_directory
df.extend(glob(f'{source_directory}/*.*'))

# Include files from the specified subdirectories
for subdir in subdirectories:
    df.extend(glob(f'{source_directory}{subdir}/*.*'))
df
```

## 78. Listing All CSV Files and Empty Directories in a Given Directory Recursively

The goal of this code is to find all CSV files and empty folders inside a specific directory and its subdirectories. The code searches through all levels of the directory, lists all CSV files, checks for empty folders, and combines the results into a single list

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Example-78.png?raw=true)

```python
# import required libraries
import os
from glob import glob

# Get all files matching the pattern
files = glob('D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/**/*.csv', recursive=True)

# Get all directories including empty ones
directories = []
for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk('D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed'):
    # Only include the directory if it is empty
    if not filenames and not dirnames:
        directories.append(dirpath)

# Combine both files and empty directories
df = sorted(files + directories)
df
```

### Output

    ['D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\03_PRS.csv',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Corvit',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\DA\\Hello_t_US.csv',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\DA\\a.csv',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\DA\\d.csv',
     'D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed\\Hello_US.csv']


'''python
from glob import glob

# Define the list of paths to search
source_directory = ['D:/Copy/Umer_Saeed/**/*.csv', 'D:/Copy/Ali_Saeed/*.txt']

# Collect all files from the specified paths using list comprehension
df = [file for path in source_directory for file in glob(path,recursive=True)]

# Display the result
