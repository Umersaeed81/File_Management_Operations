## 1. Newline (`\n`)
-  Represents a new line. When included in a string, it moves the text that follows it to the next line.


```python
print("Hello\nWorld")
```
### Output   
    Hello
    World
 

## 2. Tab (`\t`)
-  Represents a horizontal tab. It inserts a tab space in the string.


```python
print("Hello\tWorld")
```
### Output  
    Hello	World
    

## 3. Single Quote (`'\'`)
-  Used to include a single quote within a single-quoted string.


```python
print('It\'s a nice day.')
```
### Output   
    It's a nice day.
    

## 4. Double Quote (`"\"`)
- Used to include a double quote within a double-quoted string.


```python
print("She said, \"Hello!\"")
```
### Output   
    She said, "Hello!"

```python
print("This is a backslash: \\")
