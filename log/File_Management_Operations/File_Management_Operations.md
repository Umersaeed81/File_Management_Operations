# Key File Management Operations

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Management_Operations/Key_File_Management_Operations.png?raw=true)

Understanding and mastering various file management operations is vital for any programmer or system administrator. These operations form the foundation of efficient and effective file handling, ensuring that you can manage files and directories proficiently in various programming scenarios. Here are some key operations:

### [List Directory Contents](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Filtering/Advanced_File_Filtering_and_Management_Techniques.md)

Viewing the contents of a directory provides a snapshot of the files and subdirectories within. This operation is useful for gaining an overview of what is stored in a particular directory and for verifying file presence. Listing directory contents helps in auditing files and ensures that necessary files are present in the correct locations.

### Copy Files

Duplicating files from one location to another ensures a backup or creates copies for different tasks. This operation is fundamental when you need to preserve the original file while working on a copy. Copying files allows for parallel processing on the same dataset without the risk of altering the original file, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity during experiments or data processing tasks.

### Move Files

Relocating files to a new directory path effectively changes their location within the filesystem. This is useful for organizing files into appropriate directories or transferring files to different storage locations. Moving files helps in maintaining an organized directory structure, enabling easier access and better file management.

### Delete Files

Removing files from the filesystem is essential for freeing up space and managing storage. Proper file deletion helps maintain an organized and clutter-free directory structure. Careful management of file deletion ensures that only unnecessary files are removed, preventing accidental loss of important data.

### Create Directories

Making new directories to organize files allows for a structured and hierarchical storage system. This is important for keeping related files together and simplifying file retrieval. Creating directories helps in logically grouping files, making it easier to manage large datasets or project files.

### Delete Directories

Removing directories and their contents is often necessary when directories are no longer needed. This operation helps in maintaining an efficient and tidy file system by eliminating unused or outdated directories. Proper management of directory deletion ensures that storage space is used efficiently and that obsolete directories do not clutter the filesystem.

### Rename Files

Changing the name of a file can be crucial for clarity, organization, or adhering to naming conventions. Renaming files helps in identifying and categorizing them appropriately. Renaming files allows for better organization and makes it easier to follow naming conventions, improving file manageability.

### Zip Files

Compressing files into a zip archive reduces their size for storage and transfer. Zipping files is essential for saving disk space and for efficient file sharing. Zipping files facilitates easier data transfer and storage by compressing multiple files into a single archive.


### Unzip Files

 Extracting files from a zip archive allows access to compressed files. Unzipping is necessary to retrieve the original files for use after they have been compressed for storage or transfer. Unzipping files ensures that compressed data can be accessed and used as needed, restoring files to their original state.



# Advanced File Management Concepts

Beyond basic operations, advanced file management concepts help in tackling more complex scenarios and optimizing file handling processes further.

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Management_Operations/Advanced_File_Management_Concepts.png?raw=true)

### [File Metadata Management](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/Gathering_File_Metadata/File_Metadata_Extraction_and_Reporting.md)

Metadata includes information about files such as creation date, modification date, author, and file type. Managing metadata efficiently allows for better organization and quick retrieval of files based on specific criteria. Metadata can also be used to automate processes, such as archiving files that have not been modified for a certain period.

### [Data Duplication](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/Gathering_File_Metadata/File_Metadata_Extraction_and_Reporting.md)

Data duplication involves identifying and removing duplicate copies of data, reducing storage requirements and improving efficiency. This is particularly useful in environments where multiple backups or copies of similar files are maintained.

### File System Monitoring

Monitoring the file system for changes can help in detecting unauthorized access, tracking file modifications, and ensuring data integrity. Tools and scripts can be set up to alert administrators of significant changes or potential issues, enhancing security and management efficiency.



### Cloud Storage Integration

Integrating local file management with cloud storage solutions provides additional flexibility and scalability. It allows for seamless backups, access from multiple locations, and improved disaster recovery options. Understanding how to manage files both locally and in the cloud is increasingly important in modern IT environments.

### Encryption and Security 

Ensuring the security of sensitive files through encryption and access controls is a critical aspect of file management. Proper encryption practices protect data from unauthorized access, while access controls ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive information.

# Best Practices for File Management

Implementing best practices for file management helps in maintaining an organized and efficient system. Here are some key practices:

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Management_Operations/Best_Practices_for_File_Management.png?raw=true)

### Consistent Naming Conventions

Use clear and consistent naming conventions for files and directories to make them easily identifiable and searchable. Include relevant information in filenames, such as dates, project names, or versions.

### Regular Backups

Perform regular backups of important files to prevent data loss. Automated backup solutions can ensure that backups are conducted consistently and securely.

### Periodic Cleanup

Schedule periodic cleanups to remove obsolete or unnecessary files. This helps in maintaining a clutter-free file system and ensures optimal use of storage resources.

Maintain thorough documentation of your file management processes and structures. This includes keeping records of directory structures, naming conventions, and backup procedures, which is helpful for onboarding new team members and for troubleshooting.

### Automation Tools

Leverage automation tools for repetitive tasks such as backups, file transfers, and cleanup operations. Automation not only saves time but also reduces the risk of human error.

# Basic Functions of the `os` Library

The `os` library in Python provides a way of interacting with the operating system. It includes numerous functions for handling files, directories, processes, and system-level operations. Here are some basic functions of the os library that are essential for file and directory management:



## 1. `os.name`

In Python, `os.name` provides a simple way to identify the platform or operating system on which the Python interpreter is currently running. The output `'nt'` indicates that the operating system is **Windows**.

Here is a breakdown of the possible values for `os.name`:

**1. `'nt'`:** Refers to Windows (from Windows NT family, including modern Windows versions).

**2. `'posix'`:** Refers to Unix-like operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS).

**3. `'java'`:** Refers to the Java platform.

You can use `os.name` to perform platform-specific operations:

## Determining the Operating System

The objective of the code is to find out the name of the operating system that Python is running on. The code uses the `os` module to retrieve this information.

```python
import os
os.name
```


### Output

    'nt'

## Detecting and Printing the Operating System Platform

The objective of the code is to determine the type of operating system Python is running on and print a message accordingly. 
- If the system is Windows, it prints "Running on Windows."
- If it's a Unix-like system (such as Linux or macOS), it prints "Running on a Unix-like system."
- For any other or unknown platforms, it prints "Running on an unknown platform."



```python
import os

if os.name == 'nt':
    print("Running on Windows")
elif os.name == 'posix':
    print("Running on a Unix-like system")
else:
    print("Running on an unknown platform")
```
### Output

    Running on Windows
    

This will output `Running on Windows` if you are on a Windows system.

## 2. `getcwd()`

The `os.getcwd()` function in Python is used to **get the current working directory** of a Python script or interpreter session. The "current working directory" is the folder from which the Python script is being run or where the interpreter is currently located.

Here is a summary of the key points about the `os.getcwd()` function and its usefulness:

- **Returns an Absolute Path:** `os.getcwd()` returns the absolute path of the current working directory, which includes the full directory path starting from the root of the filesystem.

- **Useful for File Operations:** When you want to perform file operations, knowing the current working directory is crucial, especially when using relative paths.

- **Does Not Change the Directory:**  It only returns the current directory path and does not change it. If you want to change the working directory, you would use `os.chdir()`.

- **Building File Paths Dynamically:** When you need to create or access files relative to the current working directory.

- **Debugging:** Helps to understand where the script is executing, especially when dealing with relative paths.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Useful for writing code that needs to run on different operating systems without hardcoding file paths.

## Retrieving the Current Working Directory

The objective of the code is to find and display the current working directory where Python is running. The code uses the os module to retrieve this directory path.

```python
import os
os.getcwd()
```


### Output

    'C:\\Users\\UWX161178\\File_Management_Operations'



## 3. `os.chdir`

In Python, the `os.chdir()` function is used to change the current working directory. The path you provide to `os.chdir()` can be specified in several ways, depending on the format and type of path you use. Below are different approaches to change the directory:

## Changing the Current Working Directory Using Forward Slashes

-  Forward slashes are universally accepted as path separators in Python, even on Windows systems. This approach is straightforward and avoids issues with escape sequences.
- The objective is to change the current working directory to `D:/os_library` using forward slashes and verify the change by printing the current directory before and after the change.


```python
import os

# Print the current working directory
print(f"Before Change: {os.getcwd()}")

# Change the current working directory to 'D:/OS_Library'
os.chdir('D:/os_library')  # Use forward slashes

# Verify the change using os.getcwd()
print(f"After Change: {os.getcwd()}")
```
### Output

    Before Change: C:\Users\UWX161178\File_Management_Operations
    After Change: D:\os_library
    
## Changing the Current Working Directory Using Double Forward Slashes

- Double forward slashes are sometimes used to separate directories. While this can work, it is less conventional and might cause unexpected behavior in some cases.
- The objective is to change the current working directory to `D://os_library` using double forward slashes and verify the change by printing the current directory before and after the change.



```python
import os

# Print the current working directory
print(f"Before Change: {os.getcwd()}")

# Change the current working directory to 'D://OS_Library'
os.chdir('D://os_library')  # Use double forward slashes

# Verify the change using os.getcwd()
print(f"After Change: {os.getcwd()}")
```
### Output
    Before Change: D:\os_library
    After Change: D:\os_library

## Changing the Current Working Directory Using a Raw String for Backslashes    

-  On Windows, backslashes (`\`) are typically used as path separators. To avoid problems with escape characters, you can use raw strings by prefixing the string with r, which treats backslashes as literal characters.
- The objective is to change the current working directory to `D:\os_library` using a raw string to handle backslashes and verify the change by printing the current directory before and after the change.


```python
import os

# Print the current working directory
print(f"Before Change: {os.getcwd()}")

# Change the current working directory to 'D:\OS_Library'
os.chdir(r'D:\os_library')  # Use raw string to handle backslashes

# Verify the change using os.getcwd()
print(f"After Change: {os.getcwd()}")
```

### Output

    Before Change: D:\os_library
    After Change: D:\os_library
    

## Using Backslashes (`\`) without Raw Strings

- If you use backslashes in regular strings without specifying them as raw strings, you might encounter issues due to [escape sequences being interpreted by Python](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/File_Management_Operations/blob/main/log/File_Management_Operations/Handling_Special_Characters_in_Strings_and_File_Paths.md).

    

## 4. `os.listdir()`

The `os.listdir()` function in Python is used to **list all files and directories** in a specified directory. If no directory is specified, it defaults to listing the contents of the current working directory.

- **Function Signature:** `os.listdir(path='.')`:
  - `path (optional):` The directory path you want to list. If omitted, it defaults to the current working directory `('.')`.
- **Return Value:** `os.listdir()` returns a list of names of the entries in the specified directory. This list includes both files and directories.

- The `os.curdir` is a constant in the `os` module that represents the current directory, denoted by `'.'`. When you use os.curdir as an argument in `os.listdir()`, it behaves the same as using `'.'` directly or omitting the argument altogether.

## Listing the Contents of the Current Directory


The objective of the code is to list all the files and folders in the current working directory using Python's `os` module. The code retrieves the names of the contents of the current directory and prints them to the screen.

### Method-1

```python
import os

# List files and directories in the current working directory
contents = os.listdir('.')
print("Current Directory Contents:")
print(contents)
```
### Output
    Current Directory Contents:
    ['AhmedSaeed', 'AliSaeed', 'Bilal_Iqbal.accdb', 'Ijlal_Khan', 'New Text Document.txt', 'UmerSaeed']
    

### Method-2

```python
import os

# List files and directories in the current working directory
contents = os.listdir()
print("Current Directory Contents:")
print(contents)
```
### Output
    Current Directory Contents:
    ['AhmedSaeed', 'AliSaeed', 'Bilal_Iqbal.accdb', 'Ijlal_Khan', 'New Text Document.txt', 'UmerSaeed']
    

### Method-3

```python
import os

# List files and directories in the current working directory
contents = os.listdir(os.curdir)
print("Current Directory Contents:")
print(contents)
```
### Output

    Current Directory Contents:
    ['AhmedSaeed', 'AliSaeed', 'Bilal_Iqbal.accdb', 'Ijlal_Khan', 'New Text Document.txt', 'UmerSaeed']
    

## Listing the Contents of a Specific Directory

The objective of the code is to list all the files and folders in a specific directory (`D:/os_library`) using Python's `os` module. The code specifies the directory path, retrieves the names of the contents in that directory, and prints them to the screen.

```python
import os

# Specify the directory path
directory_path = 'D:/os_library'  # Replace with the desired directory path

# List files and directories in the specified directory
contents = os.listdir(directory_path)
print(f"Contents of {directory_path}:")
print(contents)
```
### Output
    Contents of D:/os_library:
    ['AhmedSaeed', 'AliSaeed', 'Bilal_Iqbal.accdb', 'Ijlal_Khan', 'New Text Document.txt', 'UmerSaeed']
    

## Handling Errors While Listing Directory Contents

The objective of the code is to safely attempt to list all files and folders in a specified directory using Python's `os` module. The code handles potential errors such as the directory not existing (`FileNotFoundError`) or insufficient permissions to access the directory (`PermissionError`). If the directory is accessible, it prints its contents; otherwise, it displays an appropriate error message.

```python
import os

directory_path = 'D:/os_library'  

try:
    # Attempt to list the directory contents
    contents = os.listdir(directory_path)
    print(f"Contents of {directory_path}:")
    print(contents)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The directory '{directory_path}' does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print(f"Error: You do not have permission to access '{directory_path}'.")
```
### Output
    Contents of D:/os_library:
    ['AhmedSaeed', 'AliSaeed', 'Bilal_Iqbal.accdb', 'Ijlal_Khan', 'New Text Document.txt', 'UmerSaeed']
    

## 5. `os.mkdir()`

- **Purpose:** Creates a single directory at the specified path.

- **Usage:** It can create only one directory at a time and will raise an `OSError` if the directory already exists or if the parent directory does not exist.

- **Syntax:** `os.mkdir(path, mode=0o777)`
  - **`path`**: The path to the directory you want to create.
  - **`mode`:** Optional. The permissions for the directory, represented as an octal number (default is `0o777`).

## Creating a Directory with Error Handling

The objective of the code is to create a new directory with a specified name (`new_directory`) using Python's `os` module. The code checks for potential errors: if the directory already exists (`FileExistsError`), if there is no permission to create the directory (`PermissionError`), or any other unexpected error. If the directory is created successfully, it prints a confirmation message; otherwise, it provides an appropriate error message.


```python
import os

# Specify the directory path
directory_path = 'new_directory'

# Create a single directory
try:
    os.mkdir(directory_path)
    print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' created successfully.")
except FileExistsError:
    print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' already exists.")
except PermissionError:
    print(f"Permission denied to create directory '{directory_path}'.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Output
    Directory 'new_directory' created successfully.
    


```python
os.listdir()
```

### Output

    ['AhmedSaeed',
     'AliSaeed',
     'Bilal_Iqbal.accdb',
     'Ijlal_Khan',
     'New Text Document.txt',
     'new_directory',
     'UmerSaeed']



## 6. `os.makedirs()`

**Purpose:** Creates a directory tree, i.e., it can create intermediate directories if they do not exist.

**Usage:** It can create multiple directories at once, including all necessary parent directories.

**Syntax:** `os.makedirs(name, mode=0o777, exist_ok=False)`

   - **`name`**: The path of the directory to create, including any intermediate directories.
    
   - **`mode`**: Optional. The permissions for the directories, represented as an octal number (default is `0o777`).
    
   - **`exist_ok`**: Optional. If `True`, it will not raise an error if the target directory already exists (default is `False`).


```python
import os

# Specify the directory path with intermediate directories
directory_path = 'parent_dir/child_dir/grandchild_dir'

# Create a directory tree
try:
    os.makedirs(directory_path, exist_ok=True)
    print(f"Directory tree '{directory_path}' created successfully.")
except PermissionError:
    print(f"Permission denied to create directory tree '{directory_path}'.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

    Directory tree 'parent_dir/child_dir/grandchild_dir' created successfully.
    


```python
os.listdir()
```




    ['AhmedSaeed',
     'AliSaeed',
     'Bilal_Iqbal.accdb',
     'Ijlal_Khan',
     'New Text Document.txt',
     'new_directory',
     'parent_dir',
     'UmerSaeed']



## 7. `os.rmdir()`

**Purpose:** Removes a single empty directory.

**Usage:** This function can only remove directories that are empty. It will raise an OSError if the directory is not empty or if it does not exist.

**Syntax:** `os.rmdir(path)`

  - **`path`**: The path to the directory you want to remove.


```python
import os

# Specify the directory path to remove
directory_path = 'new_directory'

# Remove the empty directory
try:
    os.rmdir(directory_path)
    print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' removed successfully.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' does not exist.")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error removing directory '{directory_path}': {e}")
```

    Directory 'new_directory' does not exist.
    


```python
os.listdir()
```




    ['AhmedSaeed',
     'AliSaeed',
     'Bilal_Iqbal.accdb',
     'Ijlal_Khan',
     'New Text Document.txt',
     'parent_dir',
     'UmerSaeed']



## 8. `os.removedirs()`

- **Purpose:** Removes a directory tree, meaning it will remove the specified directory and any empty parent directories.

- **Usage:** This function removes the target directory and its empty parent directories recursively. It will raise an `OSError` if any directory in the path is not empty.

- **Syntax:** `os.removedirs(name)`
   - **`name:`** The path to the directory you want to remove, including any empty parent directories.


```python
import os

# Create a nested directory structure for demonstration
nested_directory_path = 'D:\os_library\parent_dir\child_dir\grandchild_dir'


# Remove the nested directory structure
try:
    os.removedirs(nested_directory_path)
    print(f"Directory tree '{nested_directory_path}' removed successfully.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Directory tree '{nested_directory_path}' does not exist.")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error removing directory tree '{nested_directory_path}': {e}")
```

    Directory tree 'D:\os_library\parent_dir\child_dir\grandchild_dir' removed successfully.
    


```python
os.listdir()
```




    ['AhmedSaeed',
     'AliSaeed',
     'Bilal_Iqbal.accdb',
     'Ijlal_Khan',
     'New Text Document.txt',
     'UmerSaeed']



## 9. `os.rename()`

- **Purpose:** Renames or moves a file or directory

- **Usage**: You provide the current path and the new path (which can include a new name and/or location). If the new path is in a different directory, the file or directory will be moved to that new location.

- **Syntax:** `os.rename(src, dst)`
     - `src`: The current path of the file or directory you want to rename or move.
     - `dst`: The new path (including the new name) of the file or directory.

## Renaming a File


```python
import os

# Specify the original and new file paths
original_file = 'New Text Document.txt'
new_file = 'Kashif_Hameed.txt'



# Rename the file
try:
    os.rename(original_file, new_file)
    print(f"File renamed from '{original_file}' to '{new_file}'.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File '{original_file}' does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print(f"Permission denied to rename '{original_file}'.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error renaming file: {e}")
```

    File renamed from 'New Text Document.txt' to 'Kashif_Hameed.txt'.
    

## Renaming a Directory


```python
import os

# Specify the original and new folder paths
original_file = 'AhmedSaeed'
new_file = 'AhmadSaeed'

# Rename the file
try:
    os.rename(original_file, new_file)
    print(f"File renamed from '{original_file}' to '{new_file}'.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"File '{original_file}' does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print(f"Permission denied to rename '{original_file}'.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error renaming file: {e}")
```

    File renamed from 'AhmedSaeed' to 'AhmadSaeed'.
    

## Moving a File to a Different Directory


```python
import os

# Specify the current file path and the new path
file_to_move = 'Kashif_Hameed.txt'
new_directory = 'UmerSaeed'
new_location = os.path.join(new_directory, file_to_move)

# Create the new directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs(new_directory, exist_ok=True)

# Move the file

## 10. `os.stat()`

The `os.stat()` function in Python provides detailed information about a file or directory. It returns a `os.stat_result` object that contains various attributes related to the file or directory, such as its size, permissions, and modification times.

**Purpose:** Retrieves information about a specified file or directory.

**Usage:** Provides a `os.stat_result` object with multiple attributes that describe the file or directory.

**Syntax:** `os.stat(path)`

   - `path:` The path to the file or directory you want to get information about.

**Attributes of os.stat_result:** The `os.stat_result` object has several attributes, including:

- **st_mode:** File mode (permissions and type).

- **st_ino:** Inode number.

- **st_dev:** Device ID.

- **st_nlink:** Number of hard links.

- **st_uid:** User ID of the file owner.

- **st_gid:** Group ID of the file owner.

- **st_size:** Size of the file in bytes.

- **st_atime:** Last access time (in seconds since the epoch).

- **st_mtime:** Last modification time (in seconds since the epoch).

- **st_ctime:** Creation time (in seconds since the epoch) or metadata change time, depending on the platform.

## Basic File Information


```python
import os
import time

# Specify the path to the file

    Group ID of the file owner: 0
    

## 11. `os.path.exists(path)`

- Checks whether a specified path exists, **regardless of whether it is a file, directory, or symbolic link**.

- Returns `True` if the path exists and `False` otherwise.


```python
print(os.path.exists('D:\\os_library'))
```

    True
    


```python
print(os.path.exists('D:\\os_library\\Bilal_Iqbal.accdb'))
```

    True
    


```python
print(os.path.exists('D:\\os_library\\Umer_Saeed.csv'))
```

    False
    

## 12. `os.path.isdir(path)`

- Checks specifically whether a specified path exists **and is a directory**.
- Returns `True` if the path exists **and is a directory**, otherwise returns `False`.


```python
print(os.path.isdir('D:\\os_library'))
```

    True
    


```python
print(os.path.isdir('D:\\os_library1'))
```

    False
    


```python
print(os.path.isdir('D:\\os_library\\Bilal_Iqbal.accdb'))
```

    False
    

## 13. `isfile()`

The `os.path.isfile()` function in Python is used to check whether a given path refers to an **existing regular file** (not a directory, symbolic link, or other type of entry). It returns `True` if the path is a file and exists; otherwise, it returns `False`.


```python
print(os.path.isfile('D:\\os_library\\Bilal_Iqbal.accdb'))
```

    True
    


```python
print(os.path.isfile('D:\\os_library'))
```

    False
    


```python
print(os.path.isfile('D:\\os_library\\Umer_Saeed.accdb'))
```

    False
    

## 14.`os.access(path, mode)`

- Checks the **access permissions** of a given path for the current process.

- Takes an additional argument mode to specify the type of access check:
    - **os.F_OK**: Check if the path exists (similar to `os.path.exists()`).
    - **os.R_OK:** Check if the path is readable.
    - **os.W_OK:** Check if the path is writable.
    - **os.X_OK:** Check if the path is executable.
- Returns `True` if the specified access is allowed, False otherwise.
- `os.access()` is often used to check file accessibility rather than just existence.


```python
import os

path_to_check = 'D:\\OS_Library\\Bilal_Iqbal.accdb'

# Check if the path exists and is accessible
if os.access(path_to_check, os.F_OK):
    print(f"The file or directory '{path_to_check}' exists.")
else:
    print(f"The file or directory '{path_to_check}' does not exist.")

# Check if the path is readable
if os.access(path_to_check, os.R_OK):
    print(f"The file or directory '{path_to_check}' is readable.")
else:
    print(f"The file or directory '{path_to_check}' is not readable.")

# Check if the path is writable
if os.access(path_to_check, os.W_OK):
    print(f"The file or directory '{path_to_check}' is writable.")
else:
    print(f"The file or directory '{path_to_check}' is not writable.")

# Check if the path is executable
if os.access(path_to_check, os.X_OK):
    print(f"The file or directory '{path_to_check}' is executable.")
else:
    print(f"The file or directory '{path_to_check}' is not executable.")    
```

    The file or directory 'D:\OS_Library\Bilal_Iqbal.accdb' exists.
    The file or directory 'D:\OS_Library\Bilal_Iqbal.accdb' is readable.
    The file or directory 'D:\OS_Library\Bilal_Iqbal.accdb' is writable.
    The file or directory 'D:\OS_Library\Bilal_Iqbal.accdb' is executable.
    

## 15. `os.scandir()`

- Used to iterate over the contents of a directory, providing detailed information about each entry (file, directory, or symbolic link).

- Returns `DirEntry` objects that have methods like `.is_file()`, `.is_dir()`, and `.is_symlink()` to check the type of each entry.

- Efficient and provides a way to access file or directory metadata without making separate system calls.


```python
import os

# Specify the directory path
directory_path = 'D://OS_Library'

# Use os.scandir to get DirEntry objects
with os.scandir(directory_path) as entries:
    for entry in entries:
        print(f"Name: {entry.name}")  # Base name of the entry
        print(f"Path: {entry.path}")  # Full path of the entry
        print(f"Is File: {entry.is_file()}")  # Is it a file?
        print(f"Is Directory: {entry.is_dir()}")  # Is it a directory?
        print(f"Is Symlink: {entry.is_symlink()}")  # Is it a symbolic link?")
        
        # Get file status information
        stat_info = entry.stat()
        print(f"File size: {stat_info.st_size} bytes")
        print(f"Last modified: {time.ctime(stat_info.st_mtime)}")
        
        # Get inode number
        print(f"Inode number: {entry.inode()}")

        # File system path representation
        print(f"Filesystem path: {entry.__fspath__()}")
        print("-" * 40)
```

# Managing Disk Space

In addition to performing basic file operations, it is crucial to monitor and manage disk space effectively. Understanding how much free space is available on a disk can help prevent issues related to insufficient storage during file operations or data processing tasks. This section introduces a Python function to retrieve the available free space on a specified directory, which is essential for effective file management.


# Managing Disk Space

In addition to performing basic file operations, it is crucial to monitor and manage disk space effectively. Understanding how much free space is available on a disk can help prevent issues related to insufficient storage during file operations or data processing tasks. This section introduces a Python function to retrieve the available free space on a specified directory, which is essential for effective file management.
## Understanding `shutil.disk_usage`

The `shutil` module in Python provides a high-level interface for file operations, including disk space management. The `shutil.disk_usage()` function is particularly useful for retrieving disk usage statistics about a given path. It returns a tuple with three values:

**1. Total:**: The total size of the filesystem in bytes.

**2. Used:** The total amount of space used by files in bytes.

**3. Free:** The total amount of free space available in bytes.

To use `shutil.disk_usage()`, you need to specify a directory path (e.g., `'/'` for the root directory on Unix-based systems or `'C:/'` for the main drive on Windows). The function then calculates the disk space statistics for that particular path.

The values returned by shutil.disk_usage() are in bytes, so to convert them to more human-readable units like gigabytes (GB), you divide by 1024<sup>3</sup>.
