# Handling Special Characters in Strings and File Paths

In Python, special characters in strings are represented using escape sequences. These sequences start with a backslash (`\`) and have specific meanings. Here's a brief explanation of common escape sequences:

- **Newline (`\n`)**: Represents a new line. When included in a string, it moves the text that follows it to the next line.


```python
print("Hello\nWorld")
```

    Hello
    World
    

- **Tab (`\t`)**: Represents a horizontal tab. It inserts a tab space in the string.


```python
print("Hello\tWorld")
```

    Hello	World
    

- **Single Quote (`\'`)**: Used to include a single quote within a single-quoted string.


```python
print('It\'s a nice day.')
```

    It's a nice day.
    

- **Double Quote (`\"`):** Used to include a double quote within a double-quoted string.


```python
print("She said, \"Hello!\"")
```

    She said, "Hello!"
    

- **Backslash (`\\`):** Represents a literal backslash in the string.


```python
print("This is a backslash: \\")
```

    This is a backslash: \
